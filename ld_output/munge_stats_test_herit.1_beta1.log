--sumstats gwas_out_study_snps_test_herit.1_beta1_witha2.assoc.linear 

Interpreting column names as follows:
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
BETA:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)

Reading sumstats from gwas_out_study_snps_test_herit.1_beta1_witha2.assoc.linear into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 87568 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 12 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 38795 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
48761 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (48761 SNPs remain).
Using N = 787.0
Median value of BETA was 0.01744, which seems sensible.
